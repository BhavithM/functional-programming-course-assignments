# functional-programming-course-assignments
These are my solutions for the weekly tutorials of my Informatics 1 - Functional Programming course which I studied during my first semester of my first year at The University of Edinburgh (Fall 2015). 
The course is an introduction to functional programming using the language Haskell.
